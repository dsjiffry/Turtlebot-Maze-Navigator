# Instructions

The robot has to navigate through the maze autonomously and find the exit point. You may use any
algorithm to do this task. The width of the inside paths of the maze would be 10 inches wider than
your robot. 

The robot may find a straight wall to its right, upon exiting the maze. The wall has three slits which
could be opened or closed randomly when performing your demonstration. The robot must identify
the number of open slits in the wall while navigating forward to reach the end of the wall.

There will be three non-overlapping paths at the end of the straight wall. The robot must choose the
correct path based on the number of open slits detected in the straight wall.
The paths are not marked or guided by any means. The robot must be pre-programmed with all the
three paths to follow the corresponding trajectory. Robot should be stopped within the marked
parking zone after completing the trajectory.
